## About me

About 3 year ago I started to get interested in front-end development. Prior to that, I worked as a mathematics tutor for schoolchildren. Working as a teacher, I learned to be responsible and patient and to be patient and responsible at work. At the time when I was interested in front-end development, my level of Russian and English was low. Although it influenced the learning process, using the materials available in these languages also helped me develop my language skills.\
Almost half a year I have expereince as a Html coder. I make website html templates.\
My goal is to become a specialist in this field in the near future and further develop in the field of Web development and Data Science.
